You need to change the input and output streams from System.in and System.out to the file names mentioned in the
question.
It can be done in 2 ways :
1. Obviously, will be very slow because of Scanner.
Scanner in = new Scanner(new File("lucky.in"));
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter("lucky.out");

2. Much faster.
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("lucky.in"));
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("lucky.out")));
